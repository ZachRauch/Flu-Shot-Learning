## Business Problem
The Mayo Clinic has tasked us with predicting how likely individuals are to receive the seasonal flu vaccine. We will concentrate on:

- Predicting who will get the seasonal vaccine.
- The most significant features in determining whether or not an individual will get vaccinated?.
- How can we get more people to get vaccinated?

## Data
The data was provided by DrivenData as a part of their competition. Details about the competition and getting the data can be found https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/
